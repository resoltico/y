package main

// This is just the main entry point that simply imports and uses the
// modularized app components (no variable declarations here or anything
// else to avoid conflicts). The actual application logic is split across:
// - app_core.go: Core application structure and initialization
// - app_handlers.go: Event handlers for user interactions
// - app_menus.go: Menu setup and handlers
